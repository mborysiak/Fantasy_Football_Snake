    "\n",
    "The issue is in the availability tracking logic within the `run_sim` method. Here's what's happening:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Filtering**: Players in `to_drop` are removed from `available_predictions` and `available_adp_samples`\n",
    "2. **Availability Tracking**: The loop tracks availability only for players in `available_predictions` \n",
    "3. **Counter Initialization**: `player_selections` is initialized for ALL players (including dropped ones)\n",
    "4. **Result**: Dropped players never get their availability updated, so they have 0 total_available_count\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Issues:\n",
    "- Only tracking ~400 players instead of ~500 (after dropping 7 players)  \n",
    "- Dropped players appear in results with 0 selections/0 availability\n",
    "- The counting is mathematically correct but conceptually wrong"
